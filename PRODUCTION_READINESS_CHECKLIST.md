## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Backend Deployment**
   ```bash
   # On production server
   git pull origin main
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Run migrations
   export DATABASE_URL="your-production-db-url"
   alembic upgrade head
   
   # Restart application
   supervisorctl restart menuiq-backend
   ```

2. **Frontend Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Build for production
   npm run build
   
   # Deploy to Vercel
   vercel --prod
   ```

## üîç Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Test user authentication
- [ ] Create a test menu item
- [ ] Test multi-item functionality
- [ ] Verify image uploads
- [ ] Check FlowIQ interactions
- [ ] Monitor error logs
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Verify analytics tracking

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Reminders

1. **Never commit .env files**
2. **Use strong, unique passwords**
3. **Enable HTTPS everywhere**
4. **Set up firewall rules**
